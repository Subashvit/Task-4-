Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

1. Data Preprocessing
Load the Dataset: Read the 'Tweets' dataset into your workspace.
Clean the Data: Remove any irrelevant information such as URLs, hashtags, and special characters from the tweets.
Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Remove common words that do not contribute much to sentiment analysis, such as "the", "and", "is".
Lemmatization/Stemming: Reduce words to their base or root form.
2. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Scoring: Use sentiment analysis tools or libraries (like VADER, TextBlob, or a pre-trained model like BERT) to assign sentiment scores to each tweet.
Positive, Negative, Neutral Sentiments: Classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on their sentiment scores.
Aggregate Sentiment Scores: Summarize the sentiment scores to get an overall picture of public opinion.
3. Visualization
Sentiment Distribution: Create visualizations such as pie charts or bar graphs to show the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
Trends Over Time: Use line graphs to show how sentiment changes over a specific period.
Word Clouds: Generate word clouds to highlight the most frequently used words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
Topic Modeling: Apply techniques like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify and visualize common topics and their associated sentiments.
4. Analysis and Insights
Identify Key Sentiments: Highlight key findings such as the most positive and negative topics or brands.
Compare Sentiments: Compare sentiment patterns across different topics or brands.
Correlation with Events: Analyze how specific events correlate with changes in sentiment.
